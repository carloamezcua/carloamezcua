# Hi there, I'm Carlo 👋

### 🤖 AI & Data Science Undergraduate
I am a 4th-semester student in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** with a strong background in **Mathematics**. My focus lies at the intersection of mathematical theory and practical implementation of intelligent systems.

Currently, I am expanding my skills in **Linux environments** and **server management** while building a solid portfolio of academic and personal projects.
